### What is TorusKnot ?
TorusKnot is a Cinema 4D python plugin. It allows you to generate a 3D torus knot spline.. It uses the following mathematical properties to calculate the points of the spline:

- The variable `t`, which defines the position of each point on the spline. This variable can range from `MIN_T` to `MAX_T`, with a `T_STEP` interval between each value used.
- The radii `R` and `r`, which determine the general shape of the torus knot. `R` corresponds to `KNOT_PARAM_R0`, and `r` corresponds to `KNOT_PARAM_R1`.
- The parameter `n`, which determines the number of turns of the spline. The higher this number is, the more turns the spline will have.

The plugin also allows you to choose between cubic or linear interpolation for the spline, as well as to close or not close the spline into a loop.

By using these parameters, the TorusKnot plugin allows you to generate splines in the shape of a torus knot in a simple and fast way, offering many possibilities for creating complex 3D shapes in Cinema 4D.



### Installation:
To install the TorusKnot plugin for Cinema 4D, simply follow these steps:

1. Download the plugin from the provided link.
2. Unzip the downloaded archive and copy the "TorusKnot" folder into the Cinema 4D plugins directory.

The default location is:
- Windows: `C:\Program Files\MAXON\CINEMA 4D RXX\plugins\`
- Mac OS: `/Applications/MAXON/CINEMA 4D RXX/plugins/`

Make sure to replace "RXX" with the version number of your Cinema 4D installation. For example, for version 22, you should use "R22" instead. Once the plugin has been copied to the correct directory, you should be able to use it in Cinema 4D.
