## Overview

Torus Knot Generator is a Python plugin for Cinema 4D that provides a convenient tool for creating customizable torus knot splines. Torus knots are mathematical shapes commonly used in 3D modeling and visualization for their unique aesthetic properties. With this plugin, you can easily generate various types of torus knots directly within Cinema 4D.

## Features

- **Customizable Parameters:** Adjust parameters such as range, step, radii, and interpolation to create torus knots tailored to your specific needs.
  
- **Predefined Knots:** Choose from a list of predefined torus knot shapes for quick and easy generation.

## Properties

- **Range Min/Max:** Defines the range of the torus knot along the spline path. Specifies the start and end points of the knot generation.

- **Step:** Determines the increment value for generating points along the spline path. A smaller step size results in more points and a smoother spline.

- **R:** Specifies the major radius of the torus knot, controlling its overall size.

- **r:** Specifies the minor radius of the torus knot, determining the thickness of the knot's cross-section.

- **p:** The number of times the knot winds around the major circle of the torus, determining the number of intersections with the main circle.

- **q:** The number of times the knot winds around the minor circle of the torus, influencing the overall topology and shape of the knot.



## Installation

1. **Copy to Plugins Directory:** Copy the TorusKnot folder into your Cinema 4D plugins directory.

### Default Locations:

- **Windows:** `C:\Program Files\MAXON\CINEMA 4D RXX\plugins\`
  
- **Mac OS:** `/Applications/MAXON/CINEMA 4D RXX/plugins/`

## Usage

1. **Launch Cinema 4D:** Open Cinema 4D application.
   
2. **Access Plugin:** Navigate to the plugins menu and select "Torus Knot " to create a new Torus Knot object.
   
3. **Adjust Parameters:** Use the intuitive UI to adjust parameters and customize the appearance of the torus knot.
